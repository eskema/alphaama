= db => database

the database in alphaama is a local indexedDB instance using multiple stores.

* the "events" store is for all events from the user and also of certain kinds.
* the "authors" store is for user profiles data.
* the "stuff" store is for general modules data.


you can view a stored event or author with the command: `.aa db view <note1||npub1>`

* if the data cannot be found in the db, alphaama will try to find it on your relays.


to view more than one event, use the command: `.aa db some <number> asc`

* <number> is how many notes you want to load
* `asc` is an option to return notes in ascending order (instead of descending)


to know how many things are stored in a given store, use the command: `.aa db count <store>`
