= r => relays

* relays are kept locally and are separate from your published relays
* relays can be added to sets
* default relay set for reading is `read`
* default relay set for writing is `write`
* default relay set for disabled is `off`
* relay sets (relset) can be used in requests or to create lists
* depending from where relays were imported, some sets are added automatically (`ext`, `k3`, `k10002`, `out`, `hint`)

to add a relay, type: `. r add <url> <set_1> <set_2>`

* `url` is a valid full URL
* `set` is a relay set (a-z_0-9) 
* example command for adding multiple relays: `. r add wss://relay1.com read write, wss://relay2.org read, wss://relay3.net write`
* to remove a set from a relay, type: `. r setrm <url> <set>`
