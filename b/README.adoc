blobs stored simply on mediaservers.
content-addressed file storage using SHA256 hashes over HTTP.
authentication via signed nostr events (kind 24242).

== servers

* servers are stored locally and synced from your published kind-10063 server list
* to add a server: `. b add <url>`
* to add multiple: `. b add https://server1.com https://server2.com`
* to remove a server: `. b rm <url>`
* the first server added becomes the default

== upload

* `. b upload` opens a file picker dialog
* select files, pick a server, hit upload
* files are hashed (SHA256) before upload — the hash is the blob identifier
* returns a blob descriptor with the URL to the uploaded file

== list & delete

* `. b list` shows your blobs on the default server
* `. b delete <sha256>` removes a blob (requires signer)

== mirror

* `. b mirror <url>` copies a blob from a remote URL to your default server
* the URL must contain a 64-char hex SHA256 hash

== server list (kind 10063)

* `. mk 10063` publishes your server list as a kind-10063 replaceable event
* other users' kind-10063 events are processed automatically and stored on their profile
* same concept as kind-10002 for relays

== protocol

* BUD-03: user server lists (kind 10063)
* BUD-04: mirror (`PUT /mirror`)
* BUD-05: media optimization (`PUT /media`)
* BUD-06: upload pre-flight (`HEAD /upload`)
