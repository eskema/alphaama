= alphaama is just aa nostr fucking client

dat:

* tries to be fun and weird.
* let's you interact with nostr exposing the protocol instead of abstracting it.
* tries to be minimalistic, flexible and powerful.
* doesn't do it all yet, soon™.
* is not for everyone.
* keeps changing in breaking ways.
* has bugs and bad decisions.
* is a learning tool.
* is written in vanilla js, html and css.
* is public domain, free and open-source.
* you can do whatever the fuck you want with it.

== UI/UX

* alphaama doesn't do much on it's own, it takes commands given by the user and executes them
* it has a single input field for interaction like a Command Line Interface (CLI) wrapped in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can be interacted with
* commands are given by prefixing the input with a value (default is ".aa")
* this value also acts as a delimiter for running multiple commands (similar to &&)
* can be used to create any event type and autofills the missing required fields (raw JSON)
* you can use multiple tabs with different requests
* to reset everything, type: `.aa zzz`
* some commands can be repeated using `,` as a separator (ex: `.aa o add trust 4, theme light, pagination 500, ns gm`)
* some commands may be piped using ` | `


== (o) OPTIONS

* to add an option, type: `.aa o add` followed by `key` and `value`
* to delete options, type `.aa o del` followed by `key`, if left empty deletes all and defaults are reset

== (r) RELAYS

* relays are kept locally and are separate from your published relays
* relays can be added to sets
* default relay set for reading is `read`
* default relay set for writing is `write`
* default relay set for disabled is `off`
* relay sets (relset) can be used in requests or to create lists
* depending from where relays were imported, some sets are added automatically (`ext`, `k3`, `k10002`, `out`, `hint`)

to add a relay, type: `.aa r add <url> <set_1> <set_2>`

* `url` is a valid full URL
* `set` is a relay set (a-z_0-9) 
* example command for adding multiple relays: `.aa r add wss://relay1.com read write, wss://relay2.org read, wss://relay3.net write`
* to remove a set from a relay, type: `.aa r setrm <url> <set>`


== (u) USER

* you can use alphaama without logging in because you can read from Nostr without having to sign anything
* to sign notes, you need a signer already configured with a key (NIP7 browser extension)
* to setup a user, type: `.aa u setup`

== (q) REQUESTS

to receive events from relays, you send them requests containing your queries

* relays will start sending events one by one that match the queries
* relays will keep relaying new events as they receive them until the request is closed

to send a request, type: `.aa q req <relset> <query>`

* `relset` is either a single relay URL or a relay set id
* `query` is a nostr request filter (JSON)
* `"eose":"close"` can be added to the query, this will close the request after all stored events have been returned

example of request: `.aa q req read {"kinds":[1],"limit":10,"eose":"close"}`

the following variables can be used in queries as values:

* `"n_number"`: converts to a timestamp from `number` of days ago. ex: "n_1" converts to 1 day ago
* `"d_date_string"`: converts to a timestamp of `date_string`. ex: "d_2024-08-21"
* `"now"`: converts to the timestamp of now
* `"u"`: converts to your pubkey (if logged in)
* `"k3"`: converts to a list of pubkeys you follow (if logged in)

example of query with variables: `{"kinds":[1],"authors":["u"],"since":"n_7"}`

you can store queries so it's easier to run them
to store a query, type: `.aa q add <fid> <query>`

* `fid` is a filter identifier with the following allowed characters:  `a-z_0-9`
* `query` is explained above

to run a query on specific relays, type: `.aa q run <fid> <relset>`

* `fid` is explained above
* `relset` is a single relay url or relay set; by leaving it empty, it defaults to your `read` relay set

to run a query as outbox, type: `.aa q out <fid>` 

to close a query, type: `.aa q close <fid>`

* if `fid` is omitted all opened queries will be closed instead


video::https://v.nostr.build/hzQufBzjStD8L8j6.mp4["example of running the query `a`"]

example: `.aa q run f, u, n`


== (p) INTERACTING WITH PUBKEYS 

soon™

the WoT score system used here is very primitive and consists of 2 integer values:

* a value that you can set manually (default is 0, 9 for the logged-in pubkey and 5 for it's follows) and has influence in displaying content (renders image, video, etc). this value relates to the `trust` option
* a generated value from the number of followers a pubkey has that you also follow. this is only used as a visual hint
